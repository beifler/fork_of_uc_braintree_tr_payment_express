This module allows those using module uc_braintree_tr_payment to have a one page
form for donations. It allows you to choose the node to be displayed after the 
user donates. Also, it allows you to set the uid of the anonymous user that it 
will use for those who are not logged in when donating. You can set these 
configurations under Braintree settings within the Store Administration.

Please see the INSTALL.txt for information related to the installation of this
module.
